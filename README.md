### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
___
#### My name is Alexander Mironov, I'm **Backend Developer** :octocat: from Russia 
*(and it actually means English is not my native language, so there might be mistakes, ~~mistakes everywhere~~)*

According to my humble GitHub statistics you can see - GitHub is not my primary platform for sharing code (haha).\
*Most of my code is protected by NDAs in private repositories of commercial companies. On GitHub, I work on personal projects (although unfortunately, I have little time for it).*

- [x] come up with profile desc
- [ ] ~~push profile desc~~
- [ ] ~~merge profile desc~~
- [x] write profile desc
- [ ] publish

`So, if we are on the developers platform - it's necessary to tell about:`
### Stack
While my main language is **PHP**:rocket:, I am currently learning Golang to expand my skillset as a software engineerðŸ¤“\
Summing up, my basic stack in web is:\
  **PHP** (Symfomy/Laravel) - **MySQL** - **RabbitMQ** - **Redis** - **Docker** - *(future) Go*

### Plans
In terms of PHP development, I am eager to try something that is not yet too typical for this language, specifically asynchronous programming using Swoole framework or by integrating PHP with Go to create a multithreaded monster. I have a couple of ideas for pet projects.

In the future, I also want to learn Java and then move to Kotlin. I am particularly interested in Kotlin because PHP in its current development vector tries to become something like Kotlin in terms of language constructs and OOP.

Perhaps, but not sure, I may revisit my C programming skills in order to master PHP FFI.. For now, this is the end of my IT interests list.

### Me
Don't know what I really may to write - in my free from developing time && if it posible - like rollerblading, often watch anime (my avatar proof ãƒ„). But the most favourite hobby is PC gaming:video_game:.\
The most lovely genre - action RPG and specifically game series Dark Souls :skull:
